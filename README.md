## What is Fractal Bitcoin

Fractal Bitcoin is the only Bitcoin scaling solution that uses the Bitcoin Core code itself to recursively scale unlimited layers on top of the worldâ€™s most-secure and -held blockchain.

It is the first instance of a virtualization methodology applied to Bitcoin in the world. Fractal gradually extends the Bitcoin blockchain into a scalable computing system without breaking consistency with the Bitcoin main chain.

With strong tooling and support, building on Fractal is straightforward.
